## Getting Started

### Running natively <br>

1.) Clone both the [rails backend](https://github.com/mckennapenley/trivia-night-rails) and react frontend repos

2.) Make sure your ruby environment is at least 3.0.0

```
ruby --version
```

3.) Make sure your node version is at least 16.13.1

```
node --version
```

4.) bundle install <br>

in rails folder:

```
gem install bundle
bundle install
```

5.) npm install <br>

in react folder:

```
npm install
```

6.) Create and migrate databases <br>

in rails folder:

```
bundle exec rake db:create && bundle exec rake db:migrate
```

7.) Start the development server <br>

in rails folder:

```
rails s
```

in react folder:

```
npm run start
```

Note: answering "y" to the prompt will open the app on localhost:3001, since localhost:3000 is already being used by the rails backend
